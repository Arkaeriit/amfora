You've opened a new tab. Use the bar at the bottom to browse around. You can start typing in it by pressing the space key, or clicking the bottom bar.

Press the ? key at any time to bring up the help, and see other keybindings. Most are what you expect, you can use h/j/k/l and the arrow keys to move around text, as well as scrolling with the mouse. Common browsers shortcuts like Ctrl-T, Ctrl-W, and Ctrl-F are also supported.

Happy browsing!
